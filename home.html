  <p>I am 23 years old and currently work for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedataincubator.com">The Data Incubator</a>, doing everything from web dev to teaching PhDs the basics of Data Science. I've <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realcheapeats.com/">rebuilt food blogs</a>, interned at Google, and researched and TAd at Columbia (CC class of 2014).</p>

  <p>I enjoy math, technology, science, music (I play piano), food (eating and cooking), coffee (making and drinking), beer, writing, biking, rock climbing, video games, pool, as well as many other things. Head over to the contact page if you want to chat about any of the above (or anything at all)! </p>

  <p>Cool? Cool. You should check out my projects now!</p>
