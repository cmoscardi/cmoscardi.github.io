<h1 id="nomen">Christian Moscardi</h1>

<p>I live in NYC and currently work for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedataincubator.com">The Data Incubator</a>, helping teach PhDs the basics of Data Science. I also teach High Schoolers the basics of web dev with <a href="https://www.scripted.org/">ScriptEd</a> (they're very different than the PhDs). I've <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realcheapeats.com/">rebuilt food blogs</a>, interned at Google, and researched and TAd at Columbia.</p>

<p>I enjoy education, technology, math, music (I play piano), food (eating and cooking), coffee (making and drinking), beer, writing, biking, rock climbing, pool (let's play), and many other things. Head over to the <a href="/links.html">contact page</a> if you want to chat about any of the above (or anything at all)! </p>

<p>Cool? Cool. You should check out my <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> now!</p>
