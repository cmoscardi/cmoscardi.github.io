<h1 id="nomen">Christian Moscardi</h1>

<p>I live in NYC and am currently a researcher and student at <a href="http://cusp.nyu.edu/">NYU CUSP</a>. Previously, I ran the tech team at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedataincubator.com">The Data Incubator</a>, helping teach PhDs the basics of Data Science. Before that, I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realcheapeats.com/">rebuilt food blogs</a>, worked at Google, and researched and TAd at Columbia. One fun fact: I'm a proud inventor, and have a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017165399A1/en">patent</a> to show for it!</p>


<p>I enjoy data, technology, math, education, music (I play piano), food (eating and cooking), coffee (making and drinking), pool (let's play), and many other things. Head over to the <a href="/links.html">contact page</a> if you want to chat about any of the above (or anything at all)! </p>


<p>Cool? Cool. Thanks for reading - you should check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> now.</p>
