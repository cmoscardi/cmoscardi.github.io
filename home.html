<h1 id="name-header">Christian Moscardi</h1>

<p>I currently work at the U.S. Census Bureau, leading a team of data scientists and software engineers working on a wide variety of government IT and data modernization projects. Before that, I ran the tech team at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedataincubator.com">The Data Incubator</a>, helping teach PhDs the basics of Data Science. At other points in my life, I've studied and researched at <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/cusp">NYU CUSP</a>, worked at Google, and built a custom content management system for food blogs.</p>

<p>I enjoy data, technology, math, food (eating and cooking), cycling, pool (let's play), and many other things. Head over to the <a href="/links.html">contact page</a> if you want to chat.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading - you should check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> now.</p>
